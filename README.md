It is interesting that I can think of Structs as Factorization in Algebra - this data type can hold different types of LIKE data and group them together (bcs they are the same)...much like fatorization which enhances understanding of that mathematical property and reveals hidden properties because it allows you to study thos properties deeper...This is my exageration offcourse to let me get the concept embedded...in my head.
